This script uses ChatGPT to answer queries based on two specific files. To test it, you can extract the six "Steps for Conducting Political Economy and Policy Analysis" from the POLITICAL ECONOMY AND POLICY ANALYSIS (PEPA) SOURCEBOOK and analyze the Colombian policy to fight child malnutrition. In both cases, please supply a reduced-size file, as ChatGPT will not handle the full ones. Below is a description of the files.
